Notes

rearrange portfolios from last to first

Make animation faster 5s at best

auto scrolling so user gets attention on scrolls

explain github project 'how tree was made' (creative process)

go from scrolls animation hover to css transitions hover

icons animations more like 180ms

check myappsjs line 126 note once finished project

add jquery and gitHub to set of skills

clear up on goals like what was already given to us done and what was the obstacle ahead

<a> usage on objects themselves not on svgs

* not something to do rn

- on clicking a link that'll take u out of the site get there like a small popup stating 'View Link'

- not happy about cv download approach. Works fine on firefox but on all other browsers just opens on a new tab.

- email tooltip and copy buttons work and behave fine although sometimes they dont perform as expected.

- change scrolls themselves. Not maatching simplistic approach of general site.

- once I get onto bootsraps variables to do some edits. Make sure to add a margin-top and then delete/change the class I had to make on _shared.scss

- do searchbar on projects page

- check if accidentally you can click on footer linkedin or cv and do something while they are invisible on main page
