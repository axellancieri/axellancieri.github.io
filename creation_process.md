Probably if you're here you read a little about project 9 and/or have seen it already. If not here's a direct '<a href="https://axellancieri.github.io/index"> link </a>' to my portfolio :).

Had no clue where to begin, even tho I did watch and took notes of some design courses.. Like I knew I wanted to have some sort of motion towards what I wanted the visitor to look at, and maybe I'd use some sort of color strategy to highlight where I wanted to direct the user's attention and even have a different pattern of shapes or textures aswell to do that. The most important thing tho was not about some general ideal but having a clear idea on where to start.

After many days of dismissing and letting ideas through my head on how I wanted my site to look like I realized that I needed a plan, direction. Something to grab myself onto when I feel overwhelmed and go from there. That's where I started to write down everything that I wanted to have on my portfolio, the layout that I imagined and the things I like such as green color, nature, animations, etc.

That was the first milestone of many others, a long road ahead but I finally had some place to start from.

So well, I figured if I want to have green colors and nature on my site.. Then probably I want to have a tree, and my gf suggested I should have some squirrels going up and down and I thought to myself 'hey! why not' (big mistake that alone took me 2 weeks but that's another story and also it does look great so no complaints).

Once I had a tree we liked and the squirrels were on it behaving as intended and having some other animation here and there to make the whole image look alive, there had to be something the tree stands on, and after going through some svg hunt to see what that could be I went for some soil and bushes around it, not only made the most sense but it looked nice.

I realized at this point it would have been much easier to design everything prior to start coding but it was too late, I was way past that and also very happy with how the tree turned out so I carried on.

Alright so we have our starting point now I had to figure how I'm going to direct the user attention towards the 3 links 'about me', 'projects' and 'get in touch'. I had many ideas such as having the tree grow roots and make each one a section, or have like a wooden pole with 3 boards that would spin left and right depending on what option you pick. None of these ideas where easy to implement not only code wise but also as available SVG's online.

While browsing for other SVGs I did find some I liked, such as scrolls with flowers or leafs and a pillar that was pretty and the soil maybe can go on top of that? For some reason I liked the idea and then bit by bit the animation you see when loading the site started to take place :)

Fun fact is that I was so proud of my entire block of animation that I didn't realize that every time you loaded the site it'd take like 20 seconds to fully finish the animation, by the second or even the first time you're looking at it I'd lose half my viewers for sure, so after talking with a friend who's also been like my mentor we decided it should go down to 5 seconds tops and that's why if you see some pieces of the animation moving a bit faster than what you'd expect and with a lot of detail for the time span they have to animate.. Now you know why.

It was a fun process looking back, learned a LOT and that's what I value the most, even tho the project took longer than anticipated to finish it was a great experience for me.
