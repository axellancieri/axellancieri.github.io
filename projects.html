I believe it's a work in progress and it'll be for a long time as there's always little details I might change my mind about or new things I learn that I want to add. I believe a portfolio should express yourself so it should actually change over time as we do! With that being said I'm very proud of the outcome so far and all the code, mini challenges that were overcome such as the navbar js behavour as I didn't liked the original I had to write my own, the copy email feature being done entirely with css or using background-color and background-blend-mode on the 'projects' site to create a color change on hover using just css aswell!
              And The reason why one of the easiest projects took me the longest to complete of them all.. The creation process, if you'd like to know more about it check out this explanation more in detail '<a href="#">Here</a>'!

I knew that I wanted SVG's and animations as I didn't have a chance before to dive into the keyframe's world as much as I'd like to and I knew this was my opportunity go all in on it.<br> What I did not expect was that I'd take me so long to figure out how I wanted my site to look, what it'd have, etc. If you'd like to know more about the creation process, I made a post you can checkout '<a href="#">Here</a>'.</div>

                      Using localstorage, getting a function to iterate through multiple objects on arrays and getting the updateChart function on graphic.js were probably the hardest things to pull off together with the message user searchbar.

But I figured if I could pull that off with a for loop and some variables storing a set of arrays that would be great to get a deeper understanding on what can you do with javascript, and leaving aside the complications along the way to make it work now in retrospective it definitely paid off as I definitely leveled up my javascript on this project.

                    <div class="accordion-body">Since I had the opportunity on this project I decided to use all the functionalities that Sass has to offer, this way I was able to solidify my knowledge about the pre-processor.
                      I specifically recall in the “buttons.scss” file there were a set of buttons and I wanted them to have a subtle color change when hovering over. I knew there was a specific property in order to do it, eventually I figured out it was the “lighten” property, however since it was nested within an @each function I found it more complex to achieve the result. Despite it not being the most difficult Sass function, once I got the outcome I expected, it was extremely rewarding.</div>

                In Project 3 I embarked on HTML Forms, got into CSS selectors and started to think about accessibility.<br>
                this assignment I was given a mockup and was very diligent to replicate it and get all the placeholders and transitions just right. Moreover, I learned about csstransitions, selectors pseudo classes.<br>
                was important for me to start making a habit of having my class names properly labeled, stating their purpose.</p>

                      Not a big obstacle specifically here but the will to get through and push myself being a bit confused or overwhelmed about how things worked is definitely what I remember most of this project.
